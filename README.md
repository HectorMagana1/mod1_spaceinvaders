# mod1_spaceinvaders
Project Title: Space Invaders

Motivation: This project was brought on because I wanted to replicate an arcade game I played when I was younger. 

Tech/framework used: The languages used to create this project were: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Canvas API

How it works: The player uses the left and right arrow key to move the black square (player ship) and pressing the space bar shoots red squares (bullets). As the bullets hit the blue squares (alien ships) the alien ships disapear as well as the bullets signifying a hit. Clear out the alien ship fleat before the time runs out to pass to the next level. If the alien ships reach the player ship the game is over.
